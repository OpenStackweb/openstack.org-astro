# Astro foundation demo — September 12, 2026

This is a protected demonstration of the proposed Astro implementation, not a production-cutover certification. Start at `/comparison/` for the staff-facing tour and readiness checklist. Production and the SvelteKit beta remain independent.

## Content coverage

- All 208 previously imported editorial records render natively, including 48 previously unavailable structured templates. These include industry landing pages, summit highlights, sponsor groups, FAQs, venue maps, archival conference updates and scientific publications.
- Native Community, Learn, COA, supporting organizations and company profile templates retain the existing prepared content and service snapshots.
- All 19 research translations render with chapter navigation, illustration enlargement and language links. Existing generated PDFs were copied into content-addressed R2 objects; Git stores only the publication registry and artifact provenance. Rebuilding PDFs when content changes remains part of the future publishing workflow.
- Software is the existing React island and development dataset. Marketplace and Videos have detailed migration status pages.
- Known URLs outside the imported content set, schedules and identity/editor workflows still show review notices. The five unfinished local industry imports in the SvelteKit checkout were not silently copied or certified. In particular, Containers, Edge Computing, Telecom/NFV and Enterprise landing pages still need their final structured port. This prevents an imported raw body from being mistaken for production visual parity.

## Browser evidence

Chrome production and Astro homepage comparison: matching main heading, title, hero image, CTA, release banner and dark footer. Comparison strip and pending sign-in label are deliberate differences. Production was already signed in; Astro application sign-in is not connected.

Chrome Community comparison: matching hero, contribution choices and resource layout. Astro's project groups expand with native details; contributor links remain accessible. FAQ unmatched search returns an explicit empty result. Summit location map loads OpenStreetMap tiles, displays four Boston locations, and selecting a venue opens its popup. Research chapter links update the fragment and reader location. Use Cases filtering and media controls were checked in the previous release.

Some production navigation attempts timed out or produced blank screenshots before painting; DOM was re-read and usable visual captures obtained for homepage and Community. Do not infer full visual parity from route status or count. Continue the hosted screenshot/mobile checks after deploying this change.

## Verification

Astro check: zero errors/warnings. Build: passed. Local built route audit covers all 208 records, key demo routes, all research languages/PDF redirects and all registered public company profiles. It asserts server-rendered Software and Use Cases, one canonical and primary heading on key pages, and a real 404 for unknown URLs.

No CMS publishing, account edits or newsletter submissions were performed. Newly uploaded R2 objects are addressed by checksum, use new approved research paths, and do not change existing production or beta asset mappings.

## Hosted release checks

Initial expanded release: commit `08e6f12`, Worker `0dfc0f34-57b1-4879-8d80-c7bc722705b6`; CI run `34720436441` passed. Hosted Boston archive images load correctly and production screenshot comparison confirms the underlying hero/quote/statistics treatment. Astro deliberately retains the shared site header and an archival notice around historical pages.

At an actual 390px Chrome viewport, Community, Science, Marketplace status and the research reader had no horizontal overflow. Mobile menu expands. Historical missing project mascots were found and a fallback/lazy-loading fix added. The VMware guide has 61 readable chapters and its Download PDF action opened the protected R2 PDF in Chrome (`/assets/research-pdfs/4037-en-us.pdf`). All 43 registered public company profiles passed the local rendered-route check.
